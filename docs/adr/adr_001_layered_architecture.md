# ADR-001: Layered Architecture with Separation of Concerns

**Title:** Layered Architecture with Separation of Concerns  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-03  

## Context

The timeboxing application needed a clear architectural structure to manage complexity as it grew from a simple timeline display to a full-featured task tracking system with UI, business logic, data persistence, and external integrations.

Key requirements:
- Maintainable codebase with clear responsibilities
- Testable components with minimal coupling
- Extensible design for future features (gamification, analytics)
- Clear separation between UI concerns and business logic

## Decision

We adopted a layered architecture with the following structure:

```
├── ui/              # Presentation Layer
├── services/        # Service Layer  
├── models/          # Domain Layer
├── utils/           # Utility Layer
├── config/          # Configuration Layer
└── constants.py     # Shared Constants
```

**Layer Responsibilities:**

1. **UI Layer** (`ui/`): Tkinter-based presentation logic, event handling, user interactions
2. **Service Layer** (`services/`): Business services like notifications, task tracking
3. **Domain Layer** (`models/`): Core business entities (Schedule, Task, TimeManager)
4. **Utility Layer** (`utils/`): Cross-cutting concerns (logging, time utilities, notifications)
5. **Configuration Layer** (`config/`): Application configuration and settings

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns enables independent development and testing
- Business logic is isolated from UI framework (Tkinter)
- Services can be easily mocked for testing
- New features can be added without affecting existing layers
- Code is more maintainable and readable

**Negative:**
- Slightly more complex initial setup compared to monolithic approach
- Requires discipline to maintain layer boundaries
- Some overhead in inter-layer communication

## Alternatives

1. **Monolithic Structure**: Single module with all code - rejected due to maintainability concerns
2. **MVC Pattern**: Model-View-Controller - rejected as services layer provides better business logic organization
3. **Hexagonal Architecture**: More complex with ports/adapters - rejected as overkill for current scope
