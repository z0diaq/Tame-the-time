# ADR-008: Matplotlib for Statistics Visualization

**Title:** Matplotlib for Statistics Visualization  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-03  

## Context

The task tracking system needed to display statistical charts showing:

- Daily task completion trends over time
- Weekly aggregated completion rates
- Multi-task comparison in single charts
- Interactive filtering (ignore weekends, grouping options)
- Professional-quality visualizations for progress analysis

Requirements:
- Integration with Tkinter GUI
- Support for bar charts with multiple data series
- Customizable time groupings (Day/Week)
- Data filtering capabilities
- Export potential for future features

## Decision

We implemented Matplotlib with Tkinter backend for statistics visualization:

```python
from matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg import FigureCanvasTkAgg
from matplotlib.figure import Figure

class TaskStatisticsDialog:
    def _setup_chart_area(self):
        self.figure = Figure(figsize=(6, 4), dpi=100)
        self.canvas = FigureCanvasTkAgg(self.figure, self.chart_frame)
        self.canvas.get_tk_widget().pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)
```

**Chart Types Implemented:**
- Daily completion charts (binary completion status)
- Weekly completion rate charts (percentage-based)
- Multi-task comparison with color coding
- Time-series visualization with proper date formatting

**Features:**
- Interactive task selection (multi-select listbox)
- Dynamic chart updates based on selection
- Grouping options (Day/Week) with different visualizations
- Weekend filtering for work-focused analysis
- Professional styling with legends and proper labeling

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Professional-quality charts with extensive customization
- Excellent Tkinter integration through backend
- Rich visualization capabilities (colors, legends, annotations)
- Familiar charting library with extensive documentation
- Export capabilities for future features (PNG, PDF, etc.)
- Handles complex multi-series data elegantly

**Negative:**
- Additional dependency (matplotlib) increases application size
- Slower startup time due to matplotlib import overhead
- Memory usage higher than simple custom charts
- Platform-specific font rendering differences

## Alternatives

1. **Custom Tkinter Charts**: Lightweight but limited visualization capabilities
2. **Plotly**: Modern and interactive but requires web browser integration
3. **PyQt Charts**: Excellent but would require changing entire UI framework
4. **ASCII Charts**: Simple but unprofessional appearance for desktop application
