# ADR-007: Canvas-Based Rendering for Timeline Visualization

**Title:** Canvas-Based Rendering for Timeline Visualization  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-03  

## Context

The application needed to display a complex timeline visualization with:

- Precise time-based positioning of task cards
- Real-time progress bars showing activity completion
- Interactive elements (drag, resize, context menus)
- Smooth scrolling and zooming capabilities
- Custom visual effects (stippling, color changes, animations)
- Multiple timeline granularities (1-hour, 5-minute marks)

Standard UI widgets were insufficient for the precise positioning and custom drawing requirements of a timeline interface.

## Decision

We implemented a Canvas-based rendering system using Tkinter's Canvas widget:

**Architecture:**
```python
Canvas (main drawing surface)
├── Timeline Elements
│   ├── Hour markers (1h granularity)
│   ├── Minute markers (5m granularity)
│   └── Current time indicator
├── Task Cards
│   ├── Activity rectangles
│   ├── Progress bars (real-time)
│   ├── Text labels
│   └── Task count indicators
└── Interactive Elements
    ├── Drag handles
    ├── Resize indicators
    └── Context menu triggers
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Pixel-perfect positioning based on time calculations
- Layered rendering with proper z-order management
- Event binding for mouse interactions on canvas items
- Efficient redraw strategies to minimize performance impact
- Custom drawing functions for progress visualization

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete control over visual appearance and positioning
- Smooth animations and real-time updates possible
- Precise time-to-pixel calculations for accurate timeline
- Custom visual effects (progress bars, stippling) easily implemented
- High performance for complex visualizations
- Direct event handling on individual drawn elements

**Negative:**
- Manual layout management required
- More complex coordinate calculations
- Custom accessibility features needed
- Higher development effort compared to standard widgets
- Platform-specific rendering differences possible

## Alternatives

1. **Widget-Based Layout**: Standard UI widgets - rejected due to positioning limitations
2. **HTML5 Canvas**: Web-based rendering - rejected due to desktop application requirements
3. **OpenGL/Graphics Libraries**: Too complex for timeline visualization needs
4. **SVG Rendering**: Good for static content but poor for real-time updates
